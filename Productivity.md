[Avoiding Toxic Productivity Advice for ADHD](https://youtu.be/JsT3KPYJFl4):
# Major Flaws in NT Productivity
- Motivation: motivated by importance, rewards, consequences
	- These rly aren't motivating in the same way for ppl with ADHD
	- Rewards are great! Could build habits! *Does not bring the motivation we need to get started*
- Distractions:
	- productivity systems have distractions, tweaks, shiny objects...
- Overwhelm
	- When there's too much on our plate... just done. Everything drops, everything fails.

NTypical "Just suck it up, even if it's boring/not fun just make urself do it" NO this doesn't work, it's not like sitting on the couch is a choice our brain is completely shut down and drowning and desperate to get dopamine to get working ==and it knows that task isn't going to give us dopamine==.
- We're completely shutdown, and there's no way to just "push through and make it happen".

> "Imagine you're drowning...
> **then someone hands you a baby.**"

ADHD brains just cant survive, its desperate for oxygen (dopamine), and I can't just ignore my basic need of dopamine.
- "Get up Earlier!"
- "Workout 2 hours a day!"
- "Don't have carbs or sugar or fat or calories!"
## Eat the Frog First
*From the Mark Twain quote "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning."*
Doesn't work.
Stare at the frog for hours feeling like a failure and getting nothing done while wondering what's wrong with you.
## Break a project into its smaller steps
*Infinitely growing number of steps*
*Fiddling with how concise or elemental to make the steps*
*Estimating time*
*Get so bored u think of something interesting and open something else*
## Good Intentions, failed action
# The 4 Cs of Motivation
1. **Captivate**
	- Captivate your interest!
1. **Create**
	- Something new! Create something new! Novelty!
3. **Compete**
	- "You can't do that" NUH UH
4. **Complete**
	- Setting urgency, **exigence** =w=
	- deadlines,,

This fuels our motivation, builds up momentum. Don't eat the frog first, EAT THE ICE CREAM FIRST.

Don't break a project into its steps, BREAK IT INTO THE FIRST COUPLE STEPS.
