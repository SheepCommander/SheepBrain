- Do you recommend popping acne
- If I want to pop it, do you recommend Hydrocolloid patches or clay mask as aftercare
- If I really really care about my skin, how much should i worry about applying SPF sunscreen @ morning+midday and wearing UPF clothes. My school has lots and lots of windows and natural sunlight, and so does my house.
- How often should I exfoliate
- How should I take care of the insane acne on my back ||(that appears to be dry on the top and moist *ugh* on the bottom)||
- Retinol appears to be primarily for wrinkles & fine lines, would it be helpful?
- I was previously prescribed a certain Benzoyl peroxide topical mix (it probably had adapalene mixed in?)
- I have whiteheads all around my face, blackheads on my nose, and I've had painful inflammatory acne too

*note avoid hydrogen peroxide*
