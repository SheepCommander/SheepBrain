# External Taxes
External Taxes also called Regulatory - Implemented by Parliament on **trade**. Colonists had to pay on goods they imported from England.

Colonists disliked these, but considered them legal.

# Internal Taxes
Taxes on goods produced within the colonies. Colonists believed that the local representative assemblies had the right to tax goods, but Parliament did not. Especially considering there were no colonial representatives in Parliament.

[[Stamp Act]] - Colonists win, England does not attempt another internal tax
