**Slavery in the British Colonies**
# Khan Academy
*What would you say the main point of the Khan Academy Video “[Slavery in the British Colonies](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-2/slavery-in-the-british-colonies-lesson/v/slavery-in-the-british-colonies?modal=1)” was?

The main point is that slavery was across ALL of the colonies, forming the bedrock of the economy as well as every single industry. Although there were higher percentages in the South that relied on plantation agriculture, the North always had some.
Then it talks about the status of slaves: laws, and resistance.

*What does [this exhibit](https://www.searchablemuseum.com/to-have-and-to-hold#section-start) teach us about the type of work, the hours of work, and the dangers faced by enslaved African Americans

African Americans had many different skills. Enslaved carpenters would be used to build cabins and houses; enslaved blacksmiths could create highly skilled and impressive double helix drill bits; enslaved farmers could turn swamps into fields and create systems of dams, levees, and pulleys.
They would work all throughout daylight hours, and only at night could they then put weary effort into their own life and community, making furniture or hunting, fishing and farming for their own food.
What slaves received from their captors were only 2/3rds the food necessary to sustain an adult. Women and girls would frequently be assaulted by white men in their cabins, which offered no security.


*What are multiple ways that enslaved African-Americans built and maintained community, culture, resistance, and a sense of humanity while living through inhuman treatment?

They would form relationships and communities with each other; familial, kin, and adopted connections would allow them to provide for each other, tell stories to each other, laugh, dance, and sing together, and overall keep them strong. Blacksmiths in particular were noted as frequently moving between plantations, allowing them to gain geographical knowledge and form connections with the surrounding plantations.
Enslaved people living in communities could hunt, fish, and farm food to keep themselves nourished; use their skills to produce tools, furniture, and items to improve their community; care for, nurture, and raise children; and more.


# Stono Rebellion

What happened?  What are the historians saying the significance of the rebellion was?  Why should students of American History know about it?

Although the slaves are not able to leave behind any documents of their side of the story and what was going through their minds, historians know that a group of slaves --- in particular lead by an Angolan leader and his cohort of 20 --- raided a firearms store and started a revolt, possibly triggered by the Security Act, which required whites to carry guns to church on Sundays. The group killed whites they came across (with exception to a slave owner who was particularly kind to his slaves) and grew in number to over 50 (possibly up to 100?) before a lieutenant gathered an armed force and went to kill and capture them.

The significance of the Stono Rebellion was that it catalyzed the Negro Act, which truly solidified the institution of slavery in a way it hadn’t been before (although it still would’ve happened anyways). Whites were empowered to question any black person they saw, and curfews and more were set.

Students should know of it because it gives context to how the solidified, racialized, institute of chattel slavery used to be leaner--- this ties into the “peculiar institute” idea about how slavery was oddly over-specific. Knowing about the Stono Rebellion by proxy lets you know about how life for slaves was pre-Negro Act; it was still terrible, but some slave owners would allow extra amenities and slaves were able to travel, farm for themselves, and serve themselves on Sundays.
After the Stono Rebellion, this was no longer the case. Colonies now believed in the need for a heavily controlled and uneducated sector of negros that would not be able to organize, form communities, etc.
