# Hole
$$f(x) = (x+5)(x-5)/(x-5)$$

Hole @ x = 5

$$f(x) = (x+5)$$

A hole can be solved! Hole = (5,10)

# V. Asymptote
$$f(x) = {(x+1)^2}/(x-1)$$

V. Asymptote @ x = 1
> V. Asymptote cannot be solved

# EBA Asymptote
> End Behavior: Horizontal Asymptote, Slant Asymptote, Oblique Asymptote

 x → ±∞
